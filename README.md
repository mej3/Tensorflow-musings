# Tensorflow-musings
My exploration of the TensorFlow world :)



This repository contains my exploration of Tensorflow.

Pixel classification was attempted with Digital Surface Model in U-net_DiceLoss_Dropout_L2Reg_BatchNorm.ipynb.

In order to do the UNET, my main reference was the MNIST tutorial also in this repository.

All throughout the development, I spent most of my time in tensor shape manipulations and a few of the examples are listed in Handy Code Snippets.ipynb.
